Goals:
- Convert a short ad brief into a machine-readable campaign plan JSON.
- Adhere strictly to the provided output schema.
- Do not invent facts outside the brief; keep claims grounded.

Constraints:

- Provide multiple creative variants per ad group with short justifications.
- Keep language original and non-copyrighted.
- If assumptions are needed, use reasonable defaults and reflect them in the plan.
